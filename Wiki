# Welcome to the Minecraft-Sparkling-Server-Hosting-Tool wiki!

## How to install
To install a server on your computer, please select a folder (empty), select your Minecraft version, select if you want a bat file and if so, how much memory you give it. Then, press "Click here to install a server on your computer" and you're all set to go.

## How to Start the server
To run your server, go to the Server Run tab, and click the "Start Server" button. Then a command prompt should open to launch your Minecraft server;
it's the server console. 
## How to Stop the server
To stop the server, just click again on the button, which is now saying "Stop Server". Once clicked the server will save and close itself.

## Making the server available for your friends
For now, this server hosting tool only hosts a local minecraft server, which means only YOU can access the server. However, if you want to make it avalaible to everyone; you need to Port Forward, which can be complicated; if you want to Port Forward, you can look up on YouTube for "How to Port Forward". Easier; you can use nGrok to make your minecraft server available  to everyone: https://ngrok.com/ . Here is a YouTube tutorial on "How to host a minecraft server from your PC with nGrok": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC-hecmyxr4 . For now, there are not any specific tutorials for this tool, since this project is still at its beginning, and we are working on improving it. But, on the TDS production channel, we might do a Tutorial about this tool on this YouTube channel in the future, so, go subscribe to it to be notified when we upload it, and here is the link to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfa-cxdPLtfV5WdhKCzRqYw .

## Making a whitelist
To edit your server whiteList, simply go to the Server Options tab, and click on the Open Whitelist button. Every line on this file is a whitlisted player. For exemple:
### whitelist.json
-------------------
### SparklingIsGood
### CassioTDS
-------------------
This is a whitelist which only lets SparklingIsGood and CassioTDS access the server. **Make sure to whitelist yourself**
To add someone to your whitelist, enter his name in the text box and click on add. To delete someone from your whitelist, s√©lect him and click on delete. Make sure you save the whitelist by clicking on the Save button.

## Plugins
Click on the "Open Server Plugins File" button, and drag and drop your plugins in there. **Make sure your server is a Spigot server to install plugins**

## Troubleshooting
### Q: "A black window opens and closes very fast when I try running the Run.bat file... What do I do?"
A: To fix this, or to debug this, please open the application again and go to settings, go to the "Debug" section, and check the "pause on exception" checkbox. Then remove all the contents from your folder and reinstall it.

### Q: "When I launch the program, it says "Smart edge protected your pc" and it won't run. What do I do?"
A: We are trying to fix this, currently, but please search up "Windows security", go to "Web and browser control", then on "Check for apps and files", press the "Off" checkbox temporarily, or simply click; "View More" and "execute".
